# Tsunmai-Prediction-System-and-Dashboard
Analyzes global earthquake data (1995-2023) to predict tsunami occurrences and classify regions into risk zones. Uses XGBoost and ANN models achieving 93% accuracy, DBSCAN clustering for geographic analysis, and includes interactive Tableau dashboard for visualization.

model development, and visualization components.
Resources and Links
The interactive Tableau dashboard is available for public access, providing comprehensive visualization of earthquake patterns, tsunami risks, and geographic risk classifications. The cleaned dataset is accessible through Google Sheets, enabling researchers and analysts to conduct independent analyses or extend the current work.
The complete project repository contains all code implementations for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering algorithms, and predictive model development. Jupyter notebooks document the analytical workflow and provide reproducible results for validation and further research.
